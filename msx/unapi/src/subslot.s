;--- subslot.s: Subslot register access for the UNAPI ROM's IO window ---
;
; The IO window at 0xBFFCh lives in page 2 of our own subslot. If another
; subslot is mapped into page 2, these routines switch it to ours first.
; Which subslot that is comes from the register's own page 1 field, since
; this ROM is what page 1 holds while a call runs.
;
; Reaching the register at 0xFFFF needs page 3 mapped to the fujiveral (it's
; memory-mapped, decoded only then), and page 3 normally holds the stack --
; so interrupts are disabled and no stack access happens while page 3 is
; remapped. The switch is written out in both routines rather than shared,
; because a shared routine's RET would need a stack that is not there.
;
; Neither routine needs a "did I change anything" flag: both re-test EXPTBL
; themselves, so every possible register value round-trips unambiguously.

;   Entry:  nothing on stack, interrupts as the caller left them.
;   Exit:   L = the subslot register as it was found, to be handed to
;               io_window_exit.  0 if the slot is not expanded, which
;               io_window_exit ignores -- it re-tests EXPTBL itself.
;   Destroys: A, BC, DE, HL, flags.
;
;   If the current slot is expanded, sets page 2's subslot to our own so
;   the IO window at 0xBFFCh is decoded.
